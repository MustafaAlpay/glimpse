Basic steps to creating the synthetic data:

- Open makehuman
- Choose body type - e.g. use Modelling->Random as a starting point
- Under Pose/Animate->Skeleton select the 'Game engine' rig
- Under Pose/Animate->Pose select Tpose
- Under Geometries->Clothes add some clothes
- Under Files->Export, select 'Mesh Format' = mh2 (need to install plugin for
    this first)
- Choose export filename and export


Open Blender
(assuming you've added the mh2 import and the MakeWalk addon and the Glimpse
 paint rig addon)
- New Scene, delete the default cube
- Import .mh2, select the file exported from makehuman
- Select the body, eye and clothing meshes, Ctrl-J to join into a single mesh
- Select the mesh and the pose/rig and scale down to a more human height -
  treating blender units as meters
- Apply the scale for the mesh and the pose, by selecting each one in turn and
  pressing Ctrl-A -> Scale
- Select the rig and go into Edit Mode
- Zoom into one of the hands
- From the left 't'ool menu->Options, select 'X-axis Mirror' before modifying
- Press 'c' and select all the finger bones
- Press 'x' and delete the bones
- Extend the wrist bone to the first knuckle in the middle of the hand
- Select the rig in Object Mode and select the MakeWalk tab from the left
  't'ools menu
- Use the 'Load And Retarget' button to load a CMU mocap file (I've been using
  the 14_14.bvh star jump file)
- Scrub the animation to move the hands so you can see how the vertex weights
  around the hand need fixing
- Go into Pose Mode for the rig and then additionally select the mesh and go
  into Weight Paint mode
- Right click the hand bone
- Weight paint all the hand and fingers red. I think it might be possible to
  use the Options tab to enable mirroring of edits (I didn't try) but otherwise
  repeat the weight painting for both hands.
- Select just the rig in object mode and then under the pose object data tab
  click 'Reset Position' to leave the mesh in the untransformed Tpose position
- Shift click to select the mesh in addition to the pose
- Press Space -> 'Rig Paint Operator' (Note it will be unresponsive for a while)
